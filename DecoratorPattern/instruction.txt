Use the Decorator pattern in the following cases:

- To add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects.
- For responsibilities that can be withdrawn.
- When extension by sub-classing is impractical. Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are 
    possible and would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. Or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable for sub-classing.
